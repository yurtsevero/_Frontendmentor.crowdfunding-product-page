      <h2>About this project</h2>
      <p class="about__paragraph p1">
        About this project The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and
        stylish platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable viewing
        height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the potential to improve
        your posture and make you more comfortable while at work, helping you
        stay focused on the task at hand.
      </p>
      <p class="about__paragraph p2">
        Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra
        desk space below your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks
        to be stored under the stand.
